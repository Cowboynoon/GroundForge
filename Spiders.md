# Spiders
On this page we show (via links) examples of matrices for grounds with spiders.     
Pictures follow as soon as I learn how to.  

Adding legs to a spider is the equivalent of adding a ring to it. So, after discovering the matrix for a 4x3 legged spider, a 4x4 or bigger spider is easy. 

## Spiders, traditional
Nrs. F2 and E4 in mrs. Whiting index are connected spiders, with 4x2 and 4x3 legs.
> [4x2 legs][st2], [4x3 legs][st3], [4x4 legs][st4], [4x5 legs][st5]  

Please note: for a traditional spider, a stitch like ctctctc has to be chosen in the heart of the spider.

[Another][sa1] ground can be made using the corresponding checkers-matrix, but set the tiling parameter to "brick".

## Spiders with a hole
> [4x2 legs][sh2], [4x3 legs][sh3], [4x4 legs][sh4]

Please note: to get a clear hole in te middle, the stiches in the eye of the spider have to be chosen like the example for the 4x3 legged spider.

## Spiders in a square

Mrs. Whiting's index nrs G2 and H2.

Ground G2 has the following working scheme: (picture follows)  
It consists of a 3 legged spider with a ring in double stitch, making it a four legged spider. This spider is embedded in a square. Several of these squares are connected.  

> [4x2 legs][sq2], [4x3 legs][sq3], [4x4 legs][sq4], [4x5 legs][sq5] 
> [4x6 legs][sq6], [4x7 legs][sq7], [4x8 legs][sq8]
