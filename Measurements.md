Pin distances and angle
=======================

![](scale.png)

InkScape requires holding down the control-key while dragging a corner arrow to resize. Otherwise the angle changes.

A grid can help to resize to the desired pin distance. InkScape also provides a tool to check distances and angles, configure a grid with the document properties under the file menu.
