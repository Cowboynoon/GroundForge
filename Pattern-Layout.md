Reshape Pattern Layout
======================

The second "brick" from the top and left is a group that contains the original line sections. The other "bricks" are clones that change along with the original.

Drag the nodes of the lines in the original group to change the layout.

Note that nodes along the perimeter of the group connect to nodes in a clone. To such an intersection you may have to move nodes at different locations. In the annotated example below you will have to move p along with b, in another pattern you might have to move f along with be.
