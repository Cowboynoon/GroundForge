Reshape Pattern Layout
======================

The second "brick" from the top and left is a group that contains the original line sections. The other "bricks" are clones that change along with the original.

Drag the nodes of the lines in the original group to change the layout. Note that nodes along the edge of the group connect to nodes along other edges. So to reposition a single intersection you may hav to move nodes at different locations.
