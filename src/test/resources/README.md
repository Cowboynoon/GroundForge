# Topological exploration of patterns

The bridges page explores the interleaved patterns of https://tesselace.com/research/bridges2012/

The 4x4 pages explore patterns of the [inkscape plugin] some of the checker board matrices happen to be valid when stacked as a brick wall.

## Rearrange the thumbnails
* The matrix strings are added as id's on the SVG elements.
* Use the inspector of for example FireFox or Chrome to remove the JavaScript at the bottom of the DOM
* Drag the `<svg>` elements inside the inspector into other positions. Don't know were you dropped the last? Find the selected element, hover with the mouse over it and the thumbnail gets highlighted.
* Now and then save the work by copy-pasting the outerHTML of the `<html>` element.
