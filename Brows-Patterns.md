Browse Patterns
===============

The web applications presents a subset of preconfigured patterns. Many more are available via the advanced options.

The thumbnails below show an overview of all currently available pair diagrams. The Mac's Finder allows to quickly browse through the corresponding pattern sheets once you downloaded and unzipped the source-code of the latest [release]. Use the filenames or hints between the thumbnails to fill in the advanced options or chance the URL. 

The preconfigured samples present diagrams with proper footsides. The algorithm is not clever enough to figure out footsides under all circumstances but needs them to create the thread diagrams. The bottom form of the [interactive thumbnail] page can help to figure out a configuration that works.
