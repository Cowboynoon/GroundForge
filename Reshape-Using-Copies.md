_Customize a generated pattern to your own taste._

Colored dots help performing the tasks. Too many colors would be hard to distinguish. Therefore we have grey dots when there are four lines connecting with other dots.

The procedure is written for any state of the art [SVG editor] but the screenshots were taken with InkScape, details may be slightly different with the editor of your choice.


The Procedure
-------------

* Download a pattern-sheet from [GroundForge] and open it with an [SVG editor].
* Assemble a new patch with about four copies of the tile/repeat slightly separated from the downloaded patch. Just enough to get an impression of the pattern, yet not too much dots to select and move together. You may have to ungroup or break-apart to access just the group of objects you need.
* The colored dots guide you how to seam the copies together. The process is illustrated by the screenshots below.
* Select all the objects in the created patch and switch to node mode. A node mode allows you to change the shape of lines. The close-up of a dot in the screen shot shows the nodes that compose the circle of the dot, in the middle of the dot you see the nodes of the line ends.
* Now you can select dots to move by dragging a rectangle around them as illustrated with the close up dot. You may need to hold down shift or alt key to add another dot to the selection, just try or check the tutorials or user guide of your editor.
* You need to select the same dot in each repeat to keep the pattern repetitive. For grey dots you need to select just one per repeat. In case of a colored dot, you need to select all dots with that color.
* With the proper dots selected you can nudge them into another position by the methods provided by your editor.

When satisfied you can create a bigger patch the same way you moved the first four repeats together.

Screenshots
-----------

_On top_: Generated patches with the initial tile/repeat selected.

_Second row_: Assembling a new patch with four copies of the initial tile/repeat. Dots with the same color should still "merge" by snapping the groups of objects together. Between the two examples a close up of "merged" dots: some lines are less visible through the dot than others.

_At the bottom_: One dot per tile/repeat selected and nudged to another position.
