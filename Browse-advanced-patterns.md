The [main page] of the web application presents a subset of the available patterns. The thumbnails in the banner link to complete and valid configurations with stitches adapted to the pattern.

More patterns are available via the [advanced page]. The advanced page lets you choose from a drop down list or fill in your own matrix that defines a pattern. The combined screenshot below shows the drop down and corresponding thumbnails of pair diagrams. The number in square brackets refers to the thumbnail number on the [main page]. The sequence number not only corresponds with the thumbnails, but also with the [pattern sheets]. Between these numbers the matrix string is provided.

The Mac's Finder allows to quickly browse through the pattern sheets once you downloaded and unzipped the source-code of the latest [release]. Windows 7 does not have a native preview of SVG documents. The next best method: drag the patterns folder to the address field of your browser, keep one hand on the mouse to select the next pattern, keep the other hand on the back button on your keyboard to go back to the list.
