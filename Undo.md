as bookmark, favorite or however your browser calls it.
When recalling the bookmark you will have to generate the diagrams again with the show button.
Your browser will automatically remember the choices you made on an example page.

Undo individual fields
----------------------

When the cursor is in a stitch field you can return to a previous choice
for that field with CTRL-Z (Windows, *nix systems) or COMMAND-Z (Mac),
FireFox and Chrome also let you choose from a list of previous values with the same start,
erase the field and the down or up arrow of your keyboard shows all your previous choices.
Depending on your browser settings, these values may stay for a next session.
