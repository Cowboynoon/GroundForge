The thumbnails show patterns collected from [tesselace] publications up to 2014. This collection contains exotic patterns and some traditional grounds. Many traditional grounds are missing but many can also be used as starting point for experiments.

It may not always be possible to express the traditional patterns with a matrix. The page on reshaping patterns more or less explains how traditional patterns can be morphed into a pattern that meets the requirements to be expressed as a compact matrix. It might needs some out-of-the-box thinking, for example spiders with twelve legs require horizontal legs to meet the requirements.

The stitches should be moved to some rectangular grid positions, the connections between two stitches can travel one diagonal distance and one or two horizontal or vertical distances. This is visualized in two ways with the SVG version of the matrix [legend]. One of the visualizations is used on the matrix tab of the [main] GroundForge page. The other method is designed for the reversed engineering process: assemble the desired pattern by copy pasting the template objects:

Figure out the tiling and you can read the matrix from the drawing.
