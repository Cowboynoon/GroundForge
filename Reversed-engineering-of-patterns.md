The [thumbnails] show patterns collected from [TesseLace] in the period 2012-2014. This collection contains exotic patterns and some traditional grounds. To experiment with other traditional patterns they should be defined with a matrix, this might not always be possible.

Like you can reshape generated patterns to your taste, you can reshape traditional patterns to meet the requirements for a compact matrix. These requirements are visualized in two ways with the [SVG] version of the matrix legend. One of the visualizations is used on the matrix tab of the [main] GroundForge page. The other method is designed for the reverse engineering process. For that purpose a template provides objects each consisting of a symbol and two arrows:

Each symbol has six free snapping points, two of them should be connected with other objects. Copy-paste these objects to assemble a pattern without changing the length or directions of lines connecting the symbols. It might need some out-of-the-box thinking: the Binche snow flake example below has horizontal connections and the vertical connection is reduced to a shared stitch. Stretching the shared stitch into a kind of plait (`ctcttctc`) reveals traditional connections in the thread diagram.

The final step is figuring out the tiling and read the matrix from the symbols within one tile.
