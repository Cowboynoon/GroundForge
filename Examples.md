Various pages scattered around the web provide examples patterns.
In one or two steps these examples link to the main [GroundForge] page
with applicable values in the parameter form.
Though the number of patterns might be overwhelming,
there is still a lot of room to generate further diagram variations
by changing dimensions, footsides, stitches or (for more advanced users)
matrices that define the flow of pairs.

* A [gallery] shows 376  patterns by thumbnails of pair diagrams.
  The patterns are collected from [TesseLace.com],
  resulting from Ph.D research on _Algorithmically designed lace tessellations_.
* An [index] shows 144 patches of worked lace from
  _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920
* The [MAE-gf] pages systematically explore various families of grounds.
* A [discussion] allows anyone to post personal finds
  and/or propose candidates for this overview,
  you will need a github account for that purpose.

Explore, experiment and play!
