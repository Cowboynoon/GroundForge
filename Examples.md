Various pages scattered around the web provide examples patterns
collected with different view points.
In one or two steps these examples link to the main [GroundForge] page
with applicable values in the parameter form.
Though the number of patterns might be overwhelming,
there is still a lot of room to generate further diagram variations
by changing dimensions, shifting footsides, stitches or (for more advanced users)
matrices that define the flow of pairs.

* The [Tesselace index] shows 376  patterns by thumbnails of pair diagrams.
  The diagrams are collected from [tesseLace.com],
  resulting from Ph.D research on _Algorithmically designed lace tessellations_.
  When following the image links you will discover patterns from the tesselace [slide show].
* The [Whiting index] shows 144 patches of worked lace from
  _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920
* The [Droste effect](Droste-effect) (thread diagrams becoming pair diagrams)
  is used to show some traditional grounds.
  Many variations and different grounds are possible.
* The [MAE-gf] pages systematically explore various families of grounds.
* For those to shy to meddle with this wiki can post personal finds on a [discussion] 
  and/or propose candidates for this overview.
  You will need a github account for both types of contribution.
