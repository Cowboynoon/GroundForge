Various pages scattered around the web provide examples of patterns
collected with different lines of approach.
Each resource has individual examples, sections or pages on families of stitches such as
spiders, bias and Milanese fish or lotus.
In one or two steps the examples link to the main [GroundForge] page
with applicable values in the parameter form.


* The [Tesselace index] shows 376  patterns by thumbnails of pair diagrams.
  The diagrams are collected from [tesseLace.com],
  resulting from Ph.D research on _Algorithmically designed lace tessellations_.
  When following an image link you will discover one or more patterns from the tesselace [slide show].
* The [Droste effect](Droste-effect) page (thread diagrams used as pair diagrams)
  starts with some ready-to-show traditional grounds
  and explains with a few families of patterns
  how to mix and match you own variations with a [simple form].
* The [Whiting index] shows 144 patches of worked lace from
  _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920.
  Though each peace is just one interpretation of a pattern,
  it shows the texture of real lace.
* The [MAE-gf] pages systematically explore various families of grounds.
* For those to shy to meddle with this wiki can post personal finds on a [discussion] 
  and/or propose candidates for this overview.
  You will need a github account for both types of contribution.

Though the number of patterns (also available in copyrighted resources) might be overwhelming,
there is still a lot of room for further variations.

Explore, experiment, play and discover!
