One of the methods to create pair and thread diagrams requires a matrix for a base pattern.
The images below show how a diagonal (two left columns) base pattern needs an even number of columns
and brick tiling with an odd number of rows.
The weaving base pattern (two right columns) requires an even number of rows and always checker board tiling.
For your convenience a few dimensions are pre-configured.
You can select one from a drop down list.
