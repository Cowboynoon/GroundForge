One of the methods to design patterns requires a matrix for a base pattern.
Both types are shown below, diagonal in the two left columns, and weaving in the two right columns. 

The red rectangles illustrate a possible tiling.
Some dimensions will work with both checker board as brick tiling.

A weaving base pattern requires an even number of rows and
will always work with a checker board tiling.

A diagonal base pattern requires an even number of columns
and brick tiling in case of an odd number of rows.
An odd number of rows won't work with a number of columns divisible by four.

For your convenience a few dimensions are pre-configured.
You can select one from a drop down list.
