One of the methods to create pair and thread diagrams requires a matrix for a base pattern.
Both types are shown below, diagonal in the two left columns, and weaving in the two right columns. 

The red rectangles illustrate the tiling. 
The diagonal base pattern needs an even number of columns and brick tiling in case of an odd number of rows.
The weaving base pattern requires an even number of rows and always checker board tiling.
For your convenience a few dimensions are pre-configured, you can select one from a drop down list.

When you want larger tiles to vary more stitches or are using another pattern from the gallery,
you will have to multiply the matrix manually.
Most patterns will require some multitude for odd and even.
