The [recursive] page uses a thread diagram as pair diagram to create another thread diagram. It does so at most two times. Even with so few steps larger dimensions could quickly overwhelm a browser, while you need larger dimensions to see the full pattern.

Batch execution is much faster and doesn't make a fuss if it takes a while. It needs a few [hoops] to jump through. The triple question marks depends on where you [unzipped] GroundForge, respectively executed the `npm` command, which comes with `node.js`. Less techy users might need more detailed instructions to execute and map the last couple of [lines] with the web page for variations. So far the procedure has been tested using the _git shell_ that comes with the _GitHub Desktop_.
