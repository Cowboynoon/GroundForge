The [recursive] page uses a thread diagram as pair diagram to create another thread diagram. It does so at most two times. Even with so few steps larger dimensions could quickly overwhelm a browser, while you need larger dimensions to see the full pattern.

Off-line execution is faster, doesn't make a fuss if it takes a while, allows you to abort at your own discretion and allows as many recursion steps as your system can handle. Downside: it requires a few [hoops] to jump through: install an environment to execute JavaScript without a browser and get familiar with two or three function calls.
