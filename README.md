## How it's made

Step by step changed an [example] for [D3.js]:

- replaced the server side JSon with the hard-coded `sample.js`
- applied arrow heads and flattened them to colored line ends to emulate [color coded diagrams]
- made nodes transparent except for bobbins
- added properties to identify the links that are part of a single thread
- turned the links from lines to paths with a third node to add mid-markers for twist marks

[scala code] is compiled into `matrix-graphs.js` to generate alternatives for the `sample.js`.
These alternatives are based on matrices generated by [TesseLace.com].
The matrices contain geometric information used to initialise the animation to speed it up.
As a side effect the increased speed prevents rotated diagrams.
In the end the diagrams lack the geometric information, so only a subset is used by weeding out topological duplicates.
