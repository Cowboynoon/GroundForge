# [DEMO](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/)
A web based toolbox to design bobbin lace grounds with matching diagrams.

## How it's Made / Under the Hood

### Proof of concept with D3.js

Development started with `js/show-graph.js` and `js/sample.js`.
To get a proof of concept a force graph [example] with [D3.js] was changed into tiny thread an pair diagrams diagrams with the following steps:

- Replaced the server side JSon with the hard-coded `js/sample.js` assembled from a manual sketch `js/sample.png`.
- Applied arrow heads and flattened them to line ends to emulate [color coded pair diagrams] or to emulate the over/under effect in thread diagrams.
- Made nodes transparent except for bobbins.
- Assigned the thread number as a class to each section of a thread to assign colors.
- Turned the links from lines to paths with a third node to add mid-markers for twist marks.
- Initial coordinates replace the default random values, thus the animation stabalizes much quicker and it prevents rotated and flipped diagrams.

### Using data from TesseLace

To provide alternatives for the `js/sample.js`, [scala code] transforms a selection of matrices generated by [TesseLace.com].
The matrices contain geometric information used to initialise the diagrams, speeding up the animation as explained above.
The diagrams lack the original geometric information after completion of the animation, so topological duplicates were removed from the selection of matrices.
Downloadable pattern sheets provide geometric variations that can be customised into intermediate and other variations.

### Color-picker by MenuCool

Safari nor Internet Explorer support `<input type="color">`. The free [color-picker](http://www.menucool.com/color-picker) by MenuCool works on both platforms and was easy to apply.

## How to Contribute

You may just improve the grammar on the demo-page or on this readme, improve the layout or fix a more technical issue.
