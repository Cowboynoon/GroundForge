When choosing a pattern via a thumbnail, the most important form fields that determine a pattern (matrix and tiling) are filled in, perhaps some more.

In theory a pattern can be repeated endlessly in both directions.
A generated diagram is a cutout or patch,
for example the red rectangle in the image below.

Four parameters control the patch to generate.
The number of rows and columns determine the size of the red rectangle,
shift left and up determine the position.
Another horizontal position may mean another footside.
The example has eight rows, nine columns and is shifted by one in both directions.
