A downloadable pattern sheet of [GroundForge] may have multiple patterns. In some cases it may be relatively easy to see how one pattern is reshaped in another one. For example in the first set below the hexagon of the first variant is reshaped in to a brick for the second variant and the centre of the bow-tie in the second variant is lowered for the third variant. For the second set it becomes harder to see. Applying the same color to shapes surrounded with the same number of line segments can help to identify the transition. Note that an edge of a shape may span multiple line segments.

The a manipulated screenshot links to the real pattern sheet. Other [patterns] may come with just a single pattern that does not look at all like the color coded pair diagram. To create a regular patch that does look like the pair diagram (or any other shape you might prefer) you would have to do the reshaping by yourself by nudging the position of intersections. That is one of the factors that makes these patterns advanced.

Clones
------

The pattern repeats itself with clones, so changing the original (highlighted with dark blue) changes the rest too. Below some hints to deal with these clones.

Copy-paste a Patch
------------------

When copy-pasting a patch, InkScape puts the original group of objects at another positions than the highlighted clone. Other editors may behave differently. To get the original at the right position, group the patch before you copy it and ungroup both after copying. The larger a patch, the longer the (un)grouping takes. To locate the original, select one of the black clones, type a capital D or via the menu: edit - clone - select original.

Nudge the Intersections
-----------------------

Right click to enter the highlighted group of objects and select all objects in that group.

Switch to the node tool to move the intersections, the black lines will change accordingly. Note that nodes along the perimeter of the group connect to nodes in a clone. To move such an intersection you may have to move nodes at different locations.

Select the full patch and apply skewing (the straight arrows along the edges) to move the relative position of horizontal or vertical lines.
