_User guide for [GroundForge], a web based toolbox to design bobbin lace grounds or braids with matching diagrams._

Designing Bobbin Lace grounds
=============================

The toolkit is based on a set of configurable matching diagrams. The pages listed in the sidebar provide tutorials, tips and tricks to use the diagrams. Please feel welcome to improve the wiki pages for this toolbox: create a github account and while logged in you will have access to buttons to edit pages or create new ones.

Varying stitches and playing with the patches on a downloaded pattern sheet renders a myriad of variations for a single pattern. Shortening [Jane Atkinson]'s [citation] of the Bauhaus school of art: _experiment, play, think. Some experiments may result in innovations, but even when reinventing wheels it is your own discovery._

Purpose of the Diagrams
-----------------------

Each type of diagram plays its own role while designing bobbin lace grounds. The creative process involves several decisions, each playing a role in an iterative process.
The diagram generator can relief much tedious work that would go into these steps in ink and paper times and reduce (but not eliminate) the trial and error of experimental patches. In short:

* Start with selecting a diagram from the thumbnails (figure **a**) or change stitches and other options in other tabs.
* Specify stitches for figure **b** and **c**.
* Apply colors to individual threads in figure **c**.
* Download figure **d** and customize it into **e-h** or whatever your fancy.
* The pair diagrams of Binche, Flanders or Paris grounds are thread diagrams of a plain Torchon ground with respectively ctctc, ctct or ct.
  This principle can be applied to more stitch variations and repeated like a Droste effect.

Like the London Tube maps inform you about destinations and connections but not about geographic locations or travel time, the diagrams in figure **b** and **c** just provide instructions to create a patch of lace. 

The blue lines in figure **e** illustrate how the initial changes for **e** and **f** are made by nudging three intersections of **d** downwards. The intersections in figure **d** can be moved in many other directions by a half or full grid position or anything in between. Figure **h** is just another example with intersections nudged along another blue line. You won't find this example on the generated pattern sheets because it can't be defined in the matrix field of the advanced options.

Figure **f** and **g** represent traditional grounds. Figure **f** is a virgin ground as in **c**, figure **g** presents small Binche snowflakes which are traditionally worked in cloth stitch with twisted connections. The traditional examples illustrate the following:

* You can apply pins at intersections and/or between pairs.
* Traditional pricking don't always show how the pairs flow. A Binche pricking would only show the dots for the pins, sometimes a circle between pins reminds were to create a snowflake. A Torchon pricking with the virgin ground would have the pins and something like a Z connecting the pins to indicate the netted and barred sections, other connections are omitted. For your own grounds you might have to invent your own annotations that make the pricking less cluttered yet keep you on track while making the lace.
