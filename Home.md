Designing new grounds
=====================

The pages listed in the sidebar provide tutorials, tips and tricks to use the generated diagrams. Though screenshots and procedures may be geared to the free [InkScape], other SVG compatible [editors] will have similar functions.

Purpose of the Diagrams
-----------------------

Each type of diagram plays its own role while designing bobbin lace grounds. The creative process involves several decisions:

* Determine the paths taken by the pairs or when to make a stitch with which pairs.
* The choice of stitches that determine the actual flow of threads.
* Knowing the flow of threads you can plan where to apply different colors and/or widths. These two decisions may become part of an iterative process.
* Determine which stitches get pins and where these pins should be placed relatively to one another. These relative positions are bound by certain rules if the lace should maintain its texture without starch or wire.

The diagram generator can relief much tedious work that would go into these steps in ink and paper times and reduce (but not eliminate) the trial and error of experimental patches. Start with selecting a diagram from the thumbnails (figure a) or the advanced options, specify stitches for figure b and c and optionally apply colors to individual threads in figure c. Like the London Tube maps inform you about destinations and connections but not about geographic locations or travel time, the diagrams in figure b and c just provide instructions to create a patch of lace.

The thumbnails of figure provide some predefined configurations of diagrams, the advanced options allow for more. Figures b-d show the diagrams and download for one of the patterns, figure e-g show customized versions of the download. The blue lines in figure e illustrate how the initial changes are made by nudging three intersections downwards. Figure f and g represent traditional grounds. Figure f is a virgin ground as in c, figure g presents small Binche snowflakes which are traditionally worked in cloth stitch with twisted connections. The intersections in figure d can be moved in many other directions by a half or full grid position and still produce a pattern that would need neither starch nor wire to keep its shape. 

Varying stitches and playing with the download renders a myriad of variations for a single pattern. Shortening [Jane Atkinson]'s [citation] of the Bauhaus school of art: experiment, play, think. Some experiments may result in innovations, but even when reinventing wheels it is your own discovery and not taught.
